This repository is for Lab 5 submission.
 
## 1.1 Miwok App
 
This repo is for the following Practice Set:
- Udacity Lesson 5 Project v1 Tour Guide App
  * The city of Grand Rapids was featured in this Tour Guide App
 
## Issues and Lessons
 
A short description about the issues that you faced and the lessons that you learned.
- Utilized the Miwok app setup for the GR Tour Guide app foundation
  * Utilizing the Miwok app made me realize that the proper data structures for the tour guide app were the same or slightly modified versions of what was used in the Miwok app
- Had to create custom ItemInfo adapter and class to display the proper information for each item 
- Utilized skills from other apps to open num pad, browser, and maps for navigation depending on what user inputs the TextViews accept
  * One problem I came across was that ImageViews can't hold very high res pictures, if it does, it crashes because it can't handle it
- This app covers all of the requirements that are specified here: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/161/view
